Data collection and cleaning
=================
The 561 features collected and calculated for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The original dataset was combined with test set and train set and only the measurements with mean and standard deviation were extracted. The final dataset "activityfinal" is formed by adding activity labels (6) and subject (30) to it and each variables mean of each subject and each activity was calculated.  
Variables:
SUBJECT: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. The labels are 1:30.
ACT: Each person (SUBJECT) performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.:
 1 WALKING 
 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
 4 SITTING 
 5 STANDING 
 6 LAYING wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
